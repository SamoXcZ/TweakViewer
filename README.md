## TweakViewer (about app)
TweakViewer or (TweakV) is a simple app that lets jailbroken users view their installed tweaks on their iPhone.

## Supported Jailbreaks

TweakViewer for now Only Supports
Bootstarp Jailbreak.
(soon Dopamine aswell)

## Supported Devices and iOS
While TweakViewer Only Supports
Bootstarp Jailbreak it only supports
up from A12-A17 devices only.
The app Works from ios 15.0-17.0 ("the same versions that boostarp jailbreak does")

## Known Issues
So, there are issues with the app. During bootstrap installation, it randomizes the .jb••••• folder, making it different for everyone. If the app appears blank, it means the app couldn’t find the .jb•••• folder on your device. This issue may also occur if you try to change the app’s ‘Name,’ ‘Version,’ or ‘BundleID before installing it.

## More...
This app was developed in a short period, so it might have bugs or fewer features than expected. Please consider reporting any issues to me on my Twitter [@SamoXcZ](https://twitter.com/SamoXcZ).
